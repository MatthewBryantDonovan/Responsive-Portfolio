        <img id="aboutMe" class="mediaCenter" src="assets/images/Matt.jpg" alt="Matthew Donovan">
        <p class="clear"> Hey there! My name is Matthew Donovan and I am a Full Stack Web Developer with a past in
            hospitality leadership that goes above and
            beyond to
            bring the consumer what they want. <!-- My University of Central Flordia’s bootcamp certificate showcases
            excellence
            in browser-based technologies, databases, server-side development, and PHP. --> I regularly interact with modern
            collaboration platforms such as GitHub, Zoom, and Slack to ensure my connection with the crew is up to speed
            on the latest and greatest. With a deep passion for coding, I often inspire coding allies to keep their
            spirits up
            so the cohort may spearhead toward a unified goal. I am eagerly awaiting my home on a team that puts quality
            and
            respect toward the innovations of tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p> My personal hobbies include video games, board games, and watching movies. I approach these hobbies with
            deep thought when consuming them, often putting myself in the shoes of the designer. In doing so I end up
            finding better ways to
            best opponents, optimize actions, and realize new details.
        </p>
        <p> Head over to my portfolio page to see all of the work I did from the University of Central Flordia’s
            bootcamp I
            attended.
            Each project honed in on different types of skills. It was great to see each topic blossom into complex team
            oriented projects in which I could be a important part of the bigger picture.</p>
        <p> It was a great experience collaborating with others. Seeing how other people code gives me an awesome
            perspective on the many ways you can approach the same conclusion. Incorporating the great ideas others have
            into my
            future works is a great feeling. Diversity is the spice of life, its great to witness it in code form!</p>
        <p>Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my work or if you are looking for someone with my
            talents to be an addition to your team.</p>
